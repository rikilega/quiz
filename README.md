## What Is This?:

This project is a Javascript quiz to show case my work as a programmer, and help improve my programming skills. My page should meet the following requirements:

## Relevant Information:

This webpage and program is my first project dealing heavily in javascript. It is a timed quiz where a question is asked and the possible answers are on clickable buttons. If you click on the right answer you have 7 seconds added to the countdown timer, you will be given 1 point and you are given words of encouragement. If you click on the wrong answer, a message will display that you are wrong and 10sec will be deducted from the countdown timer. The next question will display and process is repeated until the timer runs out or you have answered all the available questions. This will end the quiz and you will be shown your score and asked to enter your initials into a form. Once submitted your score and respective initials are stored in local storage. There is a button 'Hi Scores' that you can click to view all scores and initials stored in local storage, ranked and displayed in order from highest to to lowest. I hope you will enjoy!
